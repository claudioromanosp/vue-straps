# Vue Straps

> Vuejs 2 + Boostrap 4 + Font-awesome 4 + Sass + Compass + Jquery + Webpack

## Info

This project has born due to the difficulty of adding Sass and Compass preprocessor in the webpack. Many nights of sleep were lost trying to use Sass and Compass with webpack.

I preferably like to use Bootstrap + Vuejs + Sass + Compass in my projects. 

So if you also like me, enjoy it.
There is an initial structure, but feel free to leave it your way.

## Project Struture

* Sass  : src / assets / sass
* Vuejs : src / assets / components
* Images: src / images or static
* Jquery: src / js 

## Build Setup

Step-by-step to use:

* git clone the project
* npm install (install the dependencies)
* npm run dev (start the server)
* npm run build (building app)
